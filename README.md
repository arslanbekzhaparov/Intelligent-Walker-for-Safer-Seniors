## Executive Summary

This report highlights the development journey of the Intelligent Walker for Safer Seniors (IWSS), an innovative mobility aid aimed at significantly reducing walker-related injuries among older adults. Through meticulous research and design, a critical gap in current mobility aid solutions is addressed.

### Background

Despite the higher usage of canes, walker-related injuries are disproportionately more common than with other mobility devices, often due to braking system failures. The IWSS addresses this challenge by incorporating a responsive braking system that requires minimal force to engage and activates when hands are off the handles, thereby detecting a slip or fall.

### Design and Prototyping

The design and prototyping process adhered to rigorous safety considerations, including mechanical, electronic system safety, and ergonomic design. Key design choices included:

- **Microswitch-Based Control System:** Features a low force requirement of 15 grams (0.15 Newtons) to ensure minimal user exertion while maintaining EMI resistance for robust performance in varied electromagnetic environments.
  
- **High-Performance Hub Motors:** Equipped with 6.5-inch diameter motors delivering torque outputs exceeding 20 Newton-meters, ensuring reliability and durability in demanding operational scenarios.
  
- **Durable Components:** Motor shaft mounts crafted from low carbon steel for high strength-to-weight ratio and machinability, enhancing overall durability and functionality.
  
- **Rapid Iteration Materials:** Utilized PLA for 3D printed components, including wheel pulley attachments and switch attachments, to facilitate rapid prototyping.

### Project Timeline and Budget

The project is targeted for completion by April 10th, aligning with Design and Innovation Day (DAID). The allocated budget for the project is $1,000. 

### Stakeholder Consultation

Stakeholder consultation through interviews was integral to the engineering process, ensuring the IWSS meets the diverse needs of its users. Through collaboration and innovation, the team aims to make a meaningful impact on the lives of older adults, empowering them to lead fulfilling and independent lives.
